      <h1>HTML & Semantic Elements</h1>
      <h3> A better web through better code.</h3>
        <p>In HTML, semantic elements are elements that describe their purpose and the nature of their content to both developers and browsers. In practice, semantic elements promote better organization, accessibility, more readable code, and sharing of content across the web. For example, utilizing semantic elements can identify specific areas of a webpage, like a navigation bar, or the main content of a webpage. As opposed to using a non-semantic element, such as a div or span, which tell us nothing about the type of content we can expect or its level of importance on the webpage.</p>
      <h4>TL;DNR</h4>
      <p>Semantic Elements provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Better accessibility</li>
          <li>Better organization</li>
          <li>More readable code for developers and computers</li>
        </ul>
